# Building and Testing a Basic Terraform Module

### Introduction
Terraform modules are a good way to abstract out repeated chunks of code, making it reusable across other Terraform projects and configurations. In this hands-on lab, we'll be writing a basic Terraform module from scratch and then testing it out.

### Learning Objectives
- Create the Directory Structure for the Terraform Project
- Write Your Terraform VPC Module Code
- Write Your Main Terraform Project Code
- Deploy Your Code and Test Out Your Module
